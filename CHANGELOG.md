Versioning](http://semver.org/)!

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Lint documents on the fly when changed

### Changed
- The extension now fails to activate if HLint is not present or if the HLint
  version does not meet the requirements of this extension (see below).

## 0.3.2 â€“ 2017-05-28
### Changed
- Require HLint >=2.0.8 or HLint < 2 and >= 1.9.25 because the extension now
  feeds document contents to HLint on standard input which only works in the
  aforementioned versions.

### Fixed
- Only lint Haskell files.  I simply forgot this check ðŸ™ˆ

## 0.3.1 â€“ 2017-05-22
### Added
- Add more metadata for the marketplace side

## 0.3.0 â€“ 2017-05-22
### Changed

- Apply quick fixes as workspace edit, for better undo and more reliable text
  replacement [GH-2]

## 0.2.0 - 2017-05-21
### Added
- Apply suggestions from HLint (requires
  [apply-refact](https://github.com/mpickering/apply-refact))
